WordPress Post Update Links will place some links at the beginning to Update-Sections in a Post or Page.

== Description ==

Who doesn't know this: You published a post, you add an Update and then you need some time to perhaps link the updates at the beginning of the post.

This will solve your problem: just update, put the shortcode around your update and leave the rest up to the plugin.

= Usage =

Put the Shortcode [update] around some Update-Section. You're done.

= Examples = 

Auto generated title:

> [update]
> This is an Update
> [/update]

Self defined Text:  

> [update title="My custom Update title"]
> This is an Update
> [/update]

Self defined title not shown in post

> [update title="My custom update link text" notitle="true"]
> This is an Update with a custom link text in the beginning, but not showing inside the post
> [/update]

Auto generated title not shown in post
